# Week 6 Project

## Collaborators:

## Getting started

This program takes an integer and name and outputs the name the "int" many times.
ex. integer = 5, name = "zach", "zach" prints out 5 times.

This is part of a larger project that is an argumentive machine.

1. Repeats your argument a certain number of times
2. Inserts a clapping emoji between each word in your argument
3. Highlights your opponent's spelling errors for easy vindictive correction
4. Makes a string alternate between capital and lowercase letters for mocking purposes
5. Inserts the string "thank u, next" after each argument
